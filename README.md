## Summary
As a apart of a community event (similar to the virtual pub-quizes that have been happening during isolation) I’d like to put together a Community run of the `Who wants to be a Millionaire’ video game (my version is on my PS2; my homebrew console). 

I’m currently attempting to develop a Slack plugin that posts the questions / answers / lifelines from the game to a Slack channel that everyone can vote on. 

The one with the highest votes (in some kind of time limit) is then answered in-game. The game will be streamed from my PC via a capture card and available on a call. 

I’m currently trying to determine whether the Slack plugin to Game input is possible. If not then we’ll fallback to a generic template of questions. 

Ideally before opening this up to a wider team (aka non-developers) I’d need to test if the community run works. 

In order to do a ‘alpha’ run of sorts we’ll roughly need to build a MVP Slack Plugin that consists of:
- A generic template for answering each question via votes
- A timer for each question (ideally configurable)
- A way of consolidating a final score summary
- A way of determining the Game Master so no one can cheat

I can then stream the game and manually input the highest voting answer.

If anyone wants to get involved in developing this please join the discord group and ask in the ’how can I help' channel.

I plan on updating this repository with a proper 'Todo' list once the community run idea is more solidified.
